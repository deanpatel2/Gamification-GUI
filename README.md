# Gamification-GUI

This program was developed as part of a larger confidential project. Its purpose was to generate a GUI which would display semantically-related pairs of values and ask the user for manual validation. Validation, in this context, meant to decipher whether the pair of values was noise or signal.

For example, (City: New York, ZIP: 08540) would be noise, while (City: Princeton, ZIP 08540) would be signal because the Zip matches the city.
